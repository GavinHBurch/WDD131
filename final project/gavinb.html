                Gavin Burch works for Black Ridge Elementary as a Head Custodian and has been doing this for two years now.
                I also worked as a Night Lead for Orem High School and a head sweeper at Belmont Elementary. I have learned
                what to do as a head custodian from trainings and papers I have been provided in the past two years. I hope
                this will help all new custodians or old to know what to do as a head custodian. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Gavin has been taught in small parts of HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical. I have not recieved any certifications
                on these things but can help with basic maintence of these departments. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to working as a Head Custodian at Black Ridge, I worked at Orem High School as a Night Lead. A Night Lead is there to help
                the Head Custodian during the nights with any problems that may araise. I had to help with Electrical, Plumbing, and HVAC on a 
                daily basis to help maintain the school. 
            <p>
                Gavin is currently going to BYU Idaho for a computer programming degree and is hoping to go to trade school after to learn Electrical 
                or Plumbing.
